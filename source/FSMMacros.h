// Purpose:
// This file contains the macros that make up the state machine
// language. These macros are used in the file "fsm_drone.cpp".
// These macros are designed like a jigsaw puzzle to line up
// with each other. That's the reason there are if(0)'s and such.
// Try expanding the macros in the file "fsm_drone.cpp" to see
// why they work.
